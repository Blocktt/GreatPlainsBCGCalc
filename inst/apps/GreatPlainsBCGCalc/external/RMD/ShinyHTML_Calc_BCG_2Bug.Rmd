# Calculation - Bug BCG

**BCG Level Narratives (Draft)**: modified for the Great Plains
[<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/BCG_LevelNarratives_20240514.docx" target="blank">MS
Word</a>].

**Rules (Draft)**: view the metrics and thresholds for each class
[<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/BugRules_20240514.pdf" target="blank">PDF</a>].

There are common threads across states despite the methods differences:

-   Same BCG level narratives

-   Same set of metrics (with a few exceptions) with thresholds adjusted
    to account for differences in methods and classes

-   Same taxa attributes/traits (BCG attribute, FFG, habit, voltinism)
    used for metric calculations in all the states

**Results**: for guidance on how to interpret the results, download the
**Metadata - BCG output** files on the Instructions page.

For more detailed information on development of the Great Plains BCG,
