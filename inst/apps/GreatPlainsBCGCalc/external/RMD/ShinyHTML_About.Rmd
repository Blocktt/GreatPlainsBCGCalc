# Background

This website calculates Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) scores for
benthic macroinvertebrate (hereafter "bugs") and fish samples collected
from rivers in the Great Plains (Figure 1). The USEPA has published a
practitioner's guide to BCG development that would be useful
introductory reading for someone new to the BCG framework
(<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="_blank">USEPA
2016</a>). Details on the iterative development and validation of the
Great Plains Bug and Fish BCG models found in the report by
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/main/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/Reports/Placeholder.docx" target="_blank">Jessup
and Stamp (2024)</a>.

# Funding and acknowledgments

Development of GreatPlainsBCGCalc and the underlying BCG model was
funded by the U.S. EPA. For more information, please contact Susan
Jackson (jackson.susank\@epa.gov).

Several individuals participated in the process of calibrating a BCG for
Great Plains rivers. The participants include ecological and biological
experts, authors, contributors, reviewers, and steering committee
members. The ecological and biological experts who calibrated the BCG
and developed the BCG predictive model through numerous workshops,
webinars, correspondences, and reviews included ........

Among the experts were also several contributors and reviewers. The
primary authors and facilitators were Ben Jessup and Jen Stamp of Tetra
Tech. The steering committee members provided project guidance and
administrative support for the contract between the U.S. EPA and Tetra
Tech. They included......

# Intended application

The Great Plains BCG improves the diagnostic ability of Great Plains
ecologists and other practitioners to identify degradation in biological
integrity and water quality. It is intended to be applied to bug and
fish samples that meet the following criteria:

**Geographic area**:

**Stream type**:

**Subsample size**:

-   Bugs:

-   Fish: NA

**Taxonomic resolution**:

-   Bugs: Genus or species-level as allowed by available keys, specimen
    condition, and specimen maturity.

-   Fish: Species-level as allowed by specimen condition and maturity.

**Collection gear and method**:

-   Bugs:

-   Fish:
