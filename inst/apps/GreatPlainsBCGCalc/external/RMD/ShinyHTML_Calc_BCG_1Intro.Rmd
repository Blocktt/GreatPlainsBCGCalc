# Introduction

The Great Plains Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is divided into six
levels of biological condition along a generalized stressor-response
curve, ranging from observable biological conditions found at no or low
levels of stressors (level 1) to those found at high levels of stressors
(level 6) (Figure 1)
(<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="blank">USEPA
2016</a>).

Information on BCG input metrics and rules can be found on the bug and
fish BCG subtabs. For more detailed information, see the Great Plains
BCG report [in progress] on the References page.

<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/RedundantTaxa_20240719.pdf" target="blank">**Redundant
Taxa**</a>: There is a column called EXCLUDE that will be added to your
input file automatically when you run the BCG Calculator. The EXCLUDE
field marks redundant (non-distinct) taxa. Redundant taxa are excluded
from richness metric calculations but are included in the composition
(percent individuals) metrics. There is a ‘Generate Redundant Taxa
Column’ box which is checked as the default setting since this is how
metric calculations were handled during BCG model calibration. The box
can be unchecked if you want to substitute your own designations.

For guidance on how to interpret the results, download the **Metadata -
BCG output** files on the Instructions page.
