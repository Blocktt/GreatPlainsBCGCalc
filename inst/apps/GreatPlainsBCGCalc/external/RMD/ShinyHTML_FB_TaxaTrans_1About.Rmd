# Purpose

Create an input file with the proper Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
and attributes for each calculation. Bug and fish files should be
created separately.

This function performs two steps to the input file:

1.  "Translates" the original TaxonID to the proper OTU based on the
    selected calculation.

2.  Appends the Great Plains taxa attributes, which include phylogenetic
    data for both bugs and fish. For bugs, traits include.... For fish,
    traits include BCG attributes (BCG_ATTR; BCG_ATTR2; and BCG_NUM),
    reproduction type (REPRODUCTION), trophic type (TROPHIC), habitat
    type (HABITAT), and whether the taxon is native to the Great Plains
    region (NATIVE).

The 'taxa translator' and attribute tables are based on river
biomonitoring data from rivers in the Great Plains and will be updated
as necessary.

# Input File

There are three required fields:

-   SampleID

    -   Unique sample identifier. Includes any replicate/duplicate
        information.

-   TaxaID

    -   Unique taxa name (use scientific name for both bugs and fish)

-   Count of individuals (e.g., N_Taxa)

    -   Count of taxa individuals

If you named the required fields differently in your input file, it's
ok. Click on the drop-down menus. The list of fields in your input file
will appear. Select the correct column headings.

Optional - if there are additional fields in the input file that you
want to carry through into the output file (e.g., stationID, collection
date, latitude, longitude), click on the 'Columns to keep in output'
box. The list of fields in your input file will appear. Click on the
fields that you want to include. If you change your mind and want to
remove a field, click on it and hit 'delete.'

IMPORTANT: Do not repeat the required columns. Do not include Life Stage
or other fields that are unique to the taxa and not the sample (such as
notes from the taxonomist). If a taxon occurs in more than one row for a
given sample, it will lead to double-counting of that taxon in the
richness metrics.
