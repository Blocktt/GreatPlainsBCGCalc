<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This website calculates Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) scores
for benthic macroinvertebrate (hereafter “bugs”) and fish samples
collected from rivers in the Great Plains (Figure 1). The USEPA has
published a practitioner’s guide to BCG development that would be useful
introductory reading for someone new to the BCG framework
(<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="_blank">USEPA
2016</a>). Details on the iterative development and validation of the
Great Plains Bug and Fish BCG models found in the report by

<h1>Funding and acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Development of GreatPlainsBCGCalc and the underlying BCG model was
funded by the U.S. EPA. For more information, please contact Susan
Jackson (jackson.susank@epa.gov).</p>
<p>Several individuals participated in the process of calibrating a BCG
for Great Plains rivers. The participants include ecological and
biological experts, authors, contributors, reviewers, and steering
committee members. The ecological and biological experts who calibrated
the BCG and developed the BCG predictive model through numerous
workshops, webinars, correspondences, and reviews included ……..</p>
<p>Among the experts were also several contributors and reviewers. The
primary authors and facilitators were Ben Jessup and Jen Stamp of Tetra
Tech. The steering committee members provided project guidance and
administrative support for the contract between the U.S. EPA and Tetra
Tech. They included……</p>

<div id="intended-application" class="section level1">
<h1>Intended application</h1>
<p>The Great Plains BCG improves the diagnostic ability of Great Plains
ecologists and other practitioners to identify degradation in biological
integrity and water quality. It is intended to be applied to bug and
fish samples that meet the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Geographic area</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Stream type</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Subsample size</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bugs:</p></li>
<li><p>Fish: NA</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Taxonomic resolution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bugs: Genus or species-level as allowed by available keys,
specimen condition, and specimen maturity.</p></li>
<li><p>Fish: Species-level as allowed by specimen condition and
maturity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collection gear and method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bugs:</p></li>
<li><p>Fish:</p></li>
</ul>
